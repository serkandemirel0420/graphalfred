at the root i cant create new nodes


 there should be pluss button small on bottom of node, there shoudl be string like not just stragit line it shoudl stretch as i drag and i should be able to connect


- at top make beautful path bar, that shows currently in which depth i am , i should be able to click any of them to go there

- auto align does not work good. nodes shoudl not overlaps. if i changes the posiotpn of nodes save it but if overlaps move a bit...

- store data as json in folder(seperate folder for images..) and add settings to store where in the setting panel

-store settings of the app too.




- add ci/cd - add auto update in settings.
- performance update
